The creamiest, tastiest enchiladas you'll likely ever eat are Enchiladas Suizas.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of HERDEZ Salsa Verde</li>
        <li>¾ cup Mexican cream or sour cream</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat</li>
        <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup shredded Oaxaca or Fresh Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>½ medium onion thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You may make a smooth sauce by blending 1 cup of de Herdez "Mexican Cooking Salsa Verde, Mexican Cream, cilantro, and garlic clove. Combine with the remaining Herdez salsa verde and reserve.</li>
        <li>One tablespoon of oil should be heated in a skillet over medium heat before adding the tortillas one at a time and warming them for only a few seconds on each side to soften them. As necessary, add the remaining oil. We do this to prevent the tortillas from shattering in addition to softening them for simple rolling. To drain any extra oil, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Set the oven to 350 °F.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some salt and pepper on the chicken. If you'd like, you can also add garlic powder.</li>
        <li>In a greased 9" x 12" baking dish, spread one-third of the sauce. Or if you want, separate oven-safe plates.</li>
        <li>Roll up each tortilla after placing the chicken in the center.</li>
        <li>Place the seam side down as you assemble the enchiladas.</li>
        <li>Cheese should be added before the remaining sauce is covered. Bake the cheese for 25–30 minutes, or until it begins to color. Serve right away with onion slices as a garnish. </li>
        
    </ol>
